# Python-Django-Employee-Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

KEY POINTS:
Dynamic Web Project
using Haar Cascade Algorithm
PosgreSQL used as Database
Admin and Sub-Admin Login
No login for employee

#Each employee can take attendance via their own laptop camera and it is only recorded once a day. Date and time are recorded with a employee name in the database after attendance..
I have created admin and sub-admin by distributing permissions in the database. Also the web page is dynamic, we can change picture in the profile part.
